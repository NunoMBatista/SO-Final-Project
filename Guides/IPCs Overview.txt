IPCs introduced by SystemV (UNIX version):
    Message Queues - pass messages between processes
    Semaphores - synchronize access to shared resources
    Shared Memory - share memory between processes

Shell commands:
    ipcs - show available SystemV IPCs
    ipcs -l - show system's limits
    ipcrm - deletes user owned IPC objects
    visible at /proc/sysvipc

POSIX IPCs:
    Also implements message queues, semaphores, and shared memory but more flexible and easier to use than SystemV IPCs
    Visible at /dev/shm

SysV IPCs are supported on nearly every UNIX-like system, while POSIX IPCs are not as widely supported
